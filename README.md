# JDFixer

Based on NjsFixer by Kylemc1413.

I wanted a stripped down mod that focused on JD modification and preventing floatiness, and that doesn't include NJS modification since I don't use that feature.

The behavior of the preferences has also been changed to selecting the JD from the next closest NJS entry that is lower (or equal) to the selected map's NJS.
If the map's native JD is lower than the preferred JD, the map will play at its native JD.
